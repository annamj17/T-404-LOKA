# SustainableFashion UI

Our project is running on a development branch at K3’s GitHub. Therefore cloning the frontend on GitHub should be enough to run the project along with some simple commands. The following steps are required to be able to download and run the app. Prerequisites are to have git bash and NodeJS since they are needed in order to install everything in the following steps for the frontend.

### Step 1
Clone the following GitHub repository
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:K3Imagine/SustainableFashionUI.git
```
### Step 2
Install npm and expo globally
```sh
$ npm install -g expo-cli
$ npm install
```
### Step 3
Since we are using Expo to build and run our React Native project, it is necessary to download the app “Expo Client” on your phone to be able to run the app. 
For iOS go to the App Store and search “Expo Client”.
For Android go to the Play Store and search “Expo Client”.

### Step 4
Run the project
```sh
$ npm start
```
Now you will see a QR code which you need to scan using the Client Expo app (Android) or the camera (iOS).
